# Java Lab Assignments
I have only refined the GUI codes. Other codes are old and not refined. I will try to refine this old codes as soon as possible.

## Note:
1. Here you can face package probelm because of directory. So, it is better to copy the code and make same name file then run the code in your local environment
2. It is not recommanded that follow the codes strictly. I wish you will use this codes for only catch the concepts.
3. If there is any error found, please let me know the error. I will try to solve the errors.
4. Finally, I want to say that I tried to solve this problems in easy way. But there are many ways to solve a problem. You can choose another way for your code. It's totally up on you.

# Java code compile
```bash
javac filename.java
```
# Java code run
```bash
java filename
```
# Best of Luck guys. I will try to update rest of codes soon.
